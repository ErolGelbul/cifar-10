<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This is an old project, I made with TensorFlow v2.5. There are certain functions removed in the new versions. 
I fixed up and updated everything up until the evaluation phase. At this point I can't spend more time on it.
If you wish to fix the errors, be my guest (problems start at stage 5), although I don't recommend spending more
time with tensorflow. PyTorch is definently more superior in my opinion and I will recreate this project at some
point using PyTorch.
